# ssdc lesson autobooker

requests-based script that automates the lesson slot booking process on SSDC's website cos selenium is slow and doodoo


currently some things are hardcoded, feel free to edit the script so that it is fully automated (the selection of cartID to be booked is hardcoded)


script might be brokey bcos SSDC may update their website at any time so if they do then u got siked lmao
